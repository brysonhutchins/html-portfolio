<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>As a former Teacher turned Account Executive, I bring a unique blend of communication, problem-solving, and relationship-building skills to the world of sales and technology. My experience in education has honed my ability to simplify complex concepts, engage diverse audiences, and drive meaningful outcomes—skills that translate seamlessly into solution engineering and consultative sales.

In my role as an Account Executive, I’ve developed a deep understanding of customer needs, technical solutions, and value-driven selling. Now, I’m eager to take the next steps into Presales, where I can combine my passion for technology with my talent for educating and empowering customers.</p>
